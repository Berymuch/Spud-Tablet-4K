Spud Tablet 4K Modification Files

These modifications are based off of the Spud Tablet program designed by Sadwhale Studios, which can be found on their website:

It tweaks settings in the configuration file to properly scale and center the point to fit losslessly on a 4k display. I've also included modified graphic files and templates to go with the increase in resolution- enjoy!
