Spud Tablet 4K Modification Files: https://sadwhale-studios.itch.io/spud-tablet

These modifications are based off of the Spud Tablet program designed by Sadwhale Studios.

It tweaks settings in the configuration file to properly scale and center the cursor tracking to fit losslessly on a 4k display. I've also included modified graphic files and templates to go with the increase in resolution- enjoy!
